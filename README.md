# Sixth Mass Extinction: Temporal Insurgency

## The Year Is 2055. You're About To Change Everything.

**Sixth Mass Extinction: Temporal Insurgency** is an open-source, community-driven survival shooter where you're a scientist from a collapsed future who travels back to 2025 to prevent humanity's extinction before 2035. Every decision rewrites reality, every action echoes across timelines, and every life you take—or save—reshapes the multiverse.

You are Alexei Volkov (name customizable), born 2020, quantum physicist turned temporal insurgent. In 2055, you stole time travel technology by hacking classified servers. Now you're back in 2025 with one mission: prevent the 6th Mass Extinction while hiding from your own past self. If your DNA or identity is discovered, your 5-year-old self will be eliminated.

## Core Gameplay Systems

### Temporal Paradox Management
You exist in 2025 while your younger self lives in the same timeline. You can interact with, protect, and even raise your past self, creating complex branching realities that affect global reputation and sanity.

### Revolutionary Reputation System
Every action affects how global populations perceive the revolution. Feeding oppressed indigenous communities builds reputation in the Global South, while assassinating oligarchs too early creates backlash. The system dynamically tracks your standing across 78 simulated nations and 200+ activist groups.

### AI-Powered Discourse Engine
After major operations, you craft revolutionary manifestos. Our AI system analyzes your discourse for coherence, ethical alignment, and persuasive power, then calculates reputation impact across affected populations. Trollish, hateful, or irrelevant content is filtered automatically.

### Sanity Mechanics (Inspired by Call of Cthulhu)
Every kill, every hunted animal, every temporal anomaly chips away at your sanity. High sanity improves diplomatic skills and revolutionary rhetoric. Low sanity unlocks brutal efficiency but isolates you from potential allies.

### Offensive Cybersecurity as Gameplay
Solve puzzles using real hacking concepts simplified for intuitive gameplay: frequency jamming for drones, Tor routing for investigations, Metasploit modules for CCTV breaches, identity spoofing for infiltration. No technical knowledge required—only logical thinking within authentic digital scenarios.

### Dynamic Identity and Logistics System
Forge multiple false identities, plan complex international routes, coordinate supply chains for revolutionary cells. Time passes realistically as you arrange travel from Icelandic geothermal hideouts to conflict zones in North Kivu.

## The Three-Layer Conflict

### Layer 1: The 2025 Climate Insurgency
Prevent ecological collapse by 2035 through direct action: disrupt fossil infrastructure, protect biodiversity corridors, expose corporate ecocide, and build alternative systems with Global South communities.

### Layer 2: The Temporal Cold War
Other time travelers from 2055 seek to exploit this timeline. Some work for oligarchs wanting to cement power across realities. Some belong to factions you haven't discovered yet. All operate under the same paradox constraints.

### Layer 3: The Multiversal Threat
Discover you're part of a larger conflict spanning infinite realities. A utopian timeline exists where humanity achieved harmony. Your ultimate mission expands from saving one Earth to preserving the multiverse from an incomprehensible predatory force.

## Key Narrative Missions

### The Swedish Weapon Scientist
Dr. Erik Lundgren will develop a reality-destroying temporal weapon by 2037. You accessed NSA files in 2051 detailing this. If recruited before 2030, he becomes a revolutionary scientist providing perks. After 2030, he's mind-controlled by oligarchs—forcing a moral choice: assassinate him (sanity penalty, but reverse-engineering opportunities) or take him hostage to negotiate with extractive corporations.

### Activist Rescue Operations
Access future databases to learn names, dates, and locations of upcoming assassinations of human/environmental rights activists. Prevent these killings to gain influential allies and revolutionary credibility worldwide.

### Raising Your Past Self
When your cover is inevitably compromised, extract your 5-year-old self and raise them in hiding. This creates a unique NPC companion whose development reflects your choices, teaching you about your own childhood traumas and resilience.

## Technical Implementation

### Godot 5.3 with Modular Architecture
- Core survival/shooter mechanics in GDScript 2.0
- AI systems in C# and Rust bindings
- Procedural mission generation based on real climate data
- Dynamic dialogue system with ConvAI integration for NPCs

### Revolutionary Discourse AI
- Local LLM processing player manifestos
- Ethical alignment filters against hate speech and disinformation
- Cultural context analysis for 12 geopolitical regions
- Reputation impact simulation across interconnected populations

### Voice-Enabled Companion AI
An in-game smartphone assistant provides mission hints, tactical analysis, and revolutionary history context through natural conversation, adapting to your sanity level and strategic preferences.

### Community-Driven Development
This project thrives on interdisciplinary collaboration:
- Programmers for simulation systems
- Ecologists for accurate climate modeling
- Cybersecurity experts for authentic hacking scenarios
- Political theorists for revolutionary dynamics
- Writers for branching narrative design
- Translators for global accessibility

## Development Philosophy

Sixth Mass Extinction is more than a game—it's a collective thought experiment about humanity's most urgent crossroads. We're building this openly because the questions we're asking belong to everyone: How do we organize society within planetary boundaries? What sacrifices are justified to prevent extinction? Can revolutionary change be both effective and ethical?

The answers will emerge from our global community of contributors.
