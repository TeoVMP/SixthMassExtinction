# Sixth Mass Extinction: Temporal Insurgency

> "You can't change the past. But you can create a better future from it."

## 🕰️ The Premise
The year is 2055. Humanity is collapsing. You're Dr. Alexei Volkov, a scientist from a failed future who steals time travel technology and jumps back to 2025 with one mission: **prevent the 6th Mass Extinction before 2035**.

But there's a catch: you were born in 2020. If anyone discovers your DNA or identity in 2025, your 5-year-old self will be eliminated. You must save humanity while hiding from yourself.

## 🎮 Core Gameplay

- **Dynamic Reputation**: Global populations react to your actions and manifestos

### Unique Features
